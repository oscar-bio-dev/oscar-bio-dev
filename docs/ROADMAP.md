# Oscar Mora - Digital Portfolio & Conservation Technology Hub

This repository hosts the digital portfolio and interactive development environment of **Oscar Mora**, Marine Biologist and Embedded Engineer (Conservation Technologist).

## 🚀 Mission and Architecture (Space / Industrial Grade)

This project is not a simple website. It is an **Engineering and Telemetry Hub** designed from scratch with a *bare-metal* and *zero-cost abstractions* philosophy using **Rust**. The goal is to build an interactive, concurrent, and industrial-grade platform for real-time visualization of environmental sensor data (TinyML, RS485, IoT), while simultaneously serving as a living resume.

## 🗺️ Engineering Roadmap

To ensure relentless quality and comply with industrial standards, the platform's development is divided into the following phases:

### 🟢 Phase 1: Ignition and Rigor (Foundations)
- [x] **Environment Setup:** Titanium foundations with `rust-toolchain.toml`, strict rules in `.rustfmt.toml`, and advanced configurations for `rust-analyzer`.
- [x] **Type Safety and Validation:** Pedantic Clippy rules (`clippy::all`, `clippy::pedantic`, `clippy::nursery`).
- [x] **Router Core:** Base implementation using `axum` on top of `tokio`.
- [x] **Static Server:** Static file serving (CSS/assets) via `tower-http`.
- [x] **Auditing and CI/CD:** Pre-commit hooks, `cargo-audit` (vulnerability detection), `cargo-deny` (licenses), and GitHub Actions pipelines.
- [x] **Basic Testing:** Integration of `cargo test` as a mandatory requirement in the CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation of the core logic.

### 🟡 Phase 2: Static Structure and API Contracts
- [x] **Architectural Modularization:** Clean Architecture pattern, dividing endpoints into logical domains (e.g., `/api/telemetry`, `/portfolio`).
- [x] **SSR Template Engine:** Hierarchy of layouts compiled directly into the binary using `askama` (zero parsing at runtime).
- [x] **Typed Error Handling:** Use of `thiserror` for the domain and `anyhow` for the application, with automatic mapping to HTTP status codes.
- [x] **API Contracts (OpenAPI):** Automatic generation of Swagger/OpenAPI specifications using `utoipa` to document sensor ingestion.
- [x] **Internal Documentation (rustdoc):** Strict use of doc-comments (`///`) on public structs and functions to generate live technical manuals automatically with `cargo doc`.

### 🟠 Phase 3: Telemetry, State, and Resilience
- [x] **Industrial Observability:** Structured and asynchronous logging via `tracing`, aiming to export to **OpenTelemetry (OTel)** (Prometheus/Grafana).
- [x] **Concurrent Shared State:** Safe dependency injection (`State`, `Arc`, `RwLock`) in Axum to handle the global state of the sensor fleet.
- [x] **Graceful Shutdown:** Interception of system signals (SIGINT/SIGTERM) for a safe shutdown without losing telemetry data in flight.
- [x] **Traffic Protection:** `tower` middlewares for *Rate Limiting* and *Timeout*, preventing saturation from burst data sent by faulty hardware.
- [x] **Rigorous Testing (Fuzzing):** Use of `proptest` (Property-Based Testing) against endpoints and logic to test behavior without physical hardware connected.

### 🔵 Phase 4: Persistence and Time-Series Flow
- [x] **Database Layer:** Asynchronous `sqlx` with compile-time query verification.
- [x] **Geospatial/Temporal Storage:** Preparation for PostgreSQL with **PostGIS** and **TimescaleDB** extensions (ideal for environmental time-series modeling and retention).
- [x] **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Deterministic spin-up and orchestration of the database using `docker-compose` (local) and Terraform/Nix (for production deployments).
- [x] **Fault Tolerance and Retention:** Implementation of a data retention buffer (Tokio `mpsc` async channels) with exponential backoff (capped at 8s, 5 retries) and critical logging on data loss.
- [x] **Robust IoT Ingestion:** Ultra-fast deserialization (`serde`) and strict payload validation (`validator`) before touching the database.
- [x] **Bidirectional Protocols:** WebSocket streaming for real-time telemetry broadcast to frontend clients. OTA downlink deferred until mTLS auth layer is complete.

### 🟣 Phase 5: Edge & Cloud AI Synergy (Cognitive Digital Twin)
- [ ] **Edge Inference Engine (TinyML):** Integration of Machine Learning models (exported via Edge Impulse) directly into Rust/C++ firmware using `tract` or `ort`.
- [ ] **Real-Time Edge Classification:** Microcontroller-level (ESP32, STM32, Microchip Technology, Texas Instruments) analysis of water/soil quality data for ultra-low latency anomaly detection and alerts.
- [x] **Digital Twin Architecture:** In-memory virtual representation (`LruCache`, 10K cap) of the current state of all deployed hardware nodes.
- [x] **Generative AI Hub Interface:** Integration of the Gemini LLM via Rust Axum backend using `system_instruction` schema for prompt injection protection. Dynamic real-time telemetry reasoning.
- [x] **Agent Terminal UI:** A minimalist terminal web component, acting as the frontend interface to query the Cognitive Digital Twin.

### ⚫ Phase 6: Space Grade (Orbital & Wasm)
- [x] **Reactive Wasm Frontend:** Interactive graphical interface (dashboard) compiled to **WebAssembly** (Leptos), eliminating external JS frameworks.
- [x] **Trunk/Leptos CSR:** Transition of the user interface to Leptos (Wasm) for reactive visualization of high-frequency data without JS overhead.
- [x] **Distroless Containerization:** Creation of ultra-lightweight Docker images (`scratch`, < 15MB) shielded against OS-level vulnerabilities.
- [x] **Hardware Security (mTLS):** Mutual TLS authentication using `rustls` to ensure that only sensors with valid cryptographic certificates can publish data.
- [x] **Mega-Schema Convergence:** Unified 15-field Protobuf schema aligned 1:1 between edge firmware (C/Nanopb) and backend (Rust/prost), covering environmental, particulate, aquatic, and node diagnostic data.
- [x] **Gateway Health Diagnostics:** Dedicated ingestion pipeline and TimescaleDB hypertable for edge gateway health events (SD card status, heap monitoring, uptime, degradation alerts).
